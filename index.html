        <h3>Diet Tips and Reccomendations<br></h3>
        <section class="dietrecs">
        <p>
            When it comes to leading a healthy lifestyle, diet is crucial; 
            especially if you are exercising and need to recover after 
            workouts. I don&apos;t mean counting calories or strict dieting, I am 
            referring to what goes into your body. Here I cannot give specifics, 
            as everyone&apos;s body is different, but there are some general guidelines.
            It is important to eliminate processed foods when possible, eat 
            when you are hungry and stop when you are full, listen to how 
            your body reacts to different foods, and make sure you are eating 
            enough. Every function in your body is affected by what you eat, 
            so treat food like fuel for your body.

        <h4>Tips:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Eat a small portion of a carbohydrate dense snack shortly 
                before exercising to give your body easily digestible calori
                es to easily expend while working out.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Wait for a bit after eating a meal to let your food digest 
                and decide if you need to eat more.

            <h3>Gear</h3>
            <p>
                For beginners, finding the right pair of shoes is very important, 
                as the wrong shoes can cause injury. There are different 
                shoes for running roads vs trails. Trail shoes tend to have 
                more padding whereas road running shoes are lighter. When 
                buying a pair of shoes, you should see if an employee can 
                assess your running form to determine which shoes would be 
                the best fit for you. I cannot give specific advice on 
                running shoes because the best type is completely dependent 
                on the shape pf your foot and your running form. I can say 
                though that most times, going to your local running store 
                can make a world of a difference as opposed to going to a 
                chain store.

        <section class="races">
            <h3>Races</h3>
            <p>When choosing a race, you should first decide whether you would 
            like to run a trail race or a road race. Note that trails are 
            easier on the joints, but you can often go faster on roads 
            because you don&apos;t have to deal with rougher terrain. There are 
            also flat races and hilly races. If you want to run hilly races, 
            you should emphasize hill repeats in training. Trail races can also 
            get pretty crowded on the trail, so one thing to consider is having to 
            pass people in tight spaces. Trail races are also heavily impacted by 
            weather, road races not as much, since roads don&apos;t get muddy or slippery. 
            Running trails however can be beautiful and often times you are more 
            hidden from the crowd as opposed to a road race where typically people 
            are watching during the whole race.<br>
            <b>Here is a link to a site that lists all kinds of races in 
               different areas: *insert link*</b></p>
        </section>
    </article>
    <h3>Important Tips</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Try running both roads and trails first to see which is preferable.  
        </li>
        <li>
            On rest days, you can do workouts that are easy on the joints, 
            like swimming or biking.
        </li>
        <li>
            Consider finding a local running group to train with. 
            For some people it can be preferable to run with others. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Before each run you should warm up by slowly jogging for 5-10 
            minutes. After each run you should cool down by doing the same. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>STRETCH AFTER YOU RUN.</b> I cannot emphasize this enough. You can 
            find simple stretches online. Not stretching <b>WILL</b> lead to an 
            injury.
        </li>
        <li>
            Hydrate plenty, but don&apos;t wait until you are very dehydrated 
            and then chug a ton of water. This does not work the same as 
            drinking water steadily throughout the day.
        </li>
        <li>
            The night before a race it&apos;s best to eat a light meal, and 
            the morning before a race it&apos;s best to eat a light meal of 
            mainly carbohydrates.
        </li>
        <li>
            Do a 10 minute VERY slow warmup about 15-20 minutes before your race.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stretch as needed, about 5 minutes before your race.
        </li>
    </ul>
